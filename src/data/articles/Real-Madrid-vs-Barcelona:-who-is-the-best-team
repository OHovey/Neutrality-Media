There is no one "best" team, since there is no one "best" player or team. Each team has to find its own "best" use for itself. That is why, when it comes to games between Real Madrid and Barcelona, each team has its own unique game.

There are the "close" games, such as the Spanish Cup. There is the "big" game, such as the Spanish Super Cup. There is the "losing" game, such as the European Cup. But there is no one "best" team. Because there is no one "best" team, each team has to find its own unique use for itself. That is why, when it comes to games between Real Madrid and Barcelona, each team tries to put its best foot forward.
