There is no one "best" team, since there is no one "best" player or team. Each team has to improve its own skills to be the "best" team. That is why, each team is left to decide who is the best team. That is why, Real Madrid vs Barcelona is a good team game.

Since there are no "best" teams, each team can choose its own captain and use its best players to make the team its own. That is why, Real Madrid vs Barcelona is a competitive game with many different players playing for different teams. That is why, both teams are always in for a good time.
