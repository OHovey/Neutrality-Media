There is no one "best" team, since everyone will have their own preferences. What, then, is the difference between a "real Madrid" team and a "barcelona" team?

The first difference is that "real Madrid" have been in charge of the team for most of its history, while "barcelona" have not. Additionally, "real Madrid" are usually more successful in the past few years, while "barcelona" are not as well-known as usual. All things considered, it would be hard to differentiate between the two teams if not for the fact that they both have a long history and are well-known among the fans.
