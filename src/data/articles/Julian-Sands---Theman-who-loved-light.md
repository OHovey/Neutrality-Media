Julian Sands was not your average man. He was not born into a traditional society, or born to a father who was in the military. He was not born with a say in the world. And he did not grow up with a sense of humor.

But that did not stop Julian from being loved. Julian was the man who loved light. He loved the way the light could take on different colors and patterns, and he loved the way it could light up a room or building.

He loved the way people could see the world in new ways, and he loved the way people could see into their hearts and minds. He loved the way the world could make them laugh and cry, and he loved the way it could take him on new adventures.

And that is why Julian Sands was man of the world. He was who he was because he loved the light.
