Burnley vs West Brom - who is the best team?

This is a difficult question to answer as both teams have a lot of good players. However, if we look at who has performed best in the league so far, then it is clear that Burnley are the best team. They have the best defence in the league and are currently in the top four. They have also scored the most goals in the league, which is a testament to their attacking prowess.

West Brom, on the other hand, have had a more difficult time this season. They have only scored 10 goals in the league, which is not good enough. However, they have a good defence and have not conceded many goals. They also have a good midfield, which is why they are currently in the top six.
