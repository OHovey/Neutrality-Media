Burnley vs West Brom - who is the best team?

Burnley have been one of the most consistent teams in the Premier League this season, and they are currently in fifth place. They have a good defence and a good attack, and they have scored a lot of goals.

West Brom have had a bit of a difficult season so far. They are in ninth place, and they have not been as consistent as Burnley. They have a good defence, but their attack has not been as good.
