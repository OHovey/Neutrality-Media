There is no doubt that Real Madrid are the champions of all time. They have won the Champions League twice and third place twice. Barcelona are the champions of all time. They have won the Champions League three times and have been able to win it twice more. There is no other team in the world that can even touch them when it comes to international success.

The question that remains is who will be the next champion of the Champions League? Real Madrid or Barcelona? The answer is that it will be Real Madrid. They will be the next champion because they are the best team in the world and they have the best players.

Barcelona are not as clear cut champions. They have won the Champions League twice and have reached the final twice more. They also have a some international success. However, the answer to this question is different. It will be different if Barcelona win the Champions League this year and next. They will not be able to compete with Real Madrid for the title.

The international success of Barcelona is something that will be very difficult to compete with. They have played in every single World Cup and have been in every single European Cup. They also have a lot of international experience. If they win the Champions League and European Cup, they will have done something that no other team has ever done.
